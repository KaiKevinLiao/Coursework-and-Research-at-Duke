# Coursework-and-Research-at-Duke
Kai Liao

M.A. Economics

Duke University

This is a category of some of my master coursework, RA work, and self-learning notes. I create this repository for the purpose of PhD application. It includes reading summaries, referee reports, codes for RA works, empirical problem sets, and machine learning projects.

### Notice

1. This public repository is NOT for learning purposes. It does NOT include textbooks, notes, slides, and routine theoretical problem sets. 
2. Most of the data and part of the codes have been deleted for the reason of copyright. Most of the codes are not runable due to lacking of inputs and some modules.
